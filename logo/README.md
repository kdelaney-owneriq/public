Logo Kaleidoscope
Here is a fun demonstration of logo. The program will draw polygons with randomly selected number of `sides` 3 to 10. Or, sometimes, 100 `sides`, to emulate a cicle. Then it draws the polygon repeatedly, each time turning by a randomly selected `angle` from 3 to 270 degrees. This is repeated until it has turned enough times that it has returned to the starting point. The maximum number of iterations is `angle * 360`, but, the process will terminate sooner if `angle` evenly divides 360 - i.e., `360 % angle == 0`. Finally, the program will run the loop repeatedly, each time randomly selecting new values for `sides`, `angle` and printing them along with the image.
